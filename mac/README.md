# mac setup

- Run `./mac/install.sh` from the repo root. It will install Homebrew (if needed), core tooling (tmux, neovim, ripgrep, fd, fzf, shellcheck, ctags, clang-format/tidy, python + pipx packages, nvm/node, npm linters) and link shared dotfiles via `scripts/shared.sh`. Python CLI tooling is installed via pipx to avoid system Python writes; pipx binaries live in `~/.local/bin` (on PATH via `zshrc`). The script also installs Nerd/Powerline fonts (Hack, Meslo, Fira Code, Inconsolata) via standard casks (no deprecated taps) for the prompt/airline glyphs—select one of them in your terminal emulator after install. zoxide replaces fasd for directory jumping and is installed via Homebrew.
- Keyboard remapping uses Karabiner-Elements. The script links `mac/karabiner/karabiner.json` into `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`; open Karabiner once to activate. Mappings: caps (hold) + h/j/k/l or w/a/s/d -> arrows; caps+space -> escape; caps+0 -> home; caps+4 -> end; caps tapped -> escape.
- Shared helpers live in `scripts/common.sh` and `scripts/shared.sh` to avoid duplicating install/link steps between macOS and Linux.
